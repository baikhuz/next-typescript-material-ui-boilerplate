# next-typescript-material-ui-template

## Getting Started

this is a next.js boilerplate bootstrapped with typescript.

the repo also includes eslint, prettier and husky for error checking, code formatting and pre-commit linting - make sure your IDE has eslint and prettier installed to be able to make use of these features

clone the repo and install deps and husky config:

```bash
yarn install
yarn husky install
```

Run the development server:

```bash
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.ts`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.
